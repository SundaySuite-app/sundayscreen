// Regression gate for docs/COMMAND_AUDIT_2026-08.md — a command that the audit
// found reachable from the UI must not silently go dark again, and a freshly
// registered command must not sit unclassified (nobody having said "yes, this
// one is meant to be unreachable for now").
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the audit's headline number (118 of 178 registered commands
// reachable from the renderer) is a snapshot, not a standing guarantee. Nothing
// stopped a future refactor from deleting the one call site that reached a
// command — the shim would still compile (the fallback/`call()` plumbing
// doesn't care whether anything downstream calls it), so the loss is invisible
// until a feature quietly stops working. This script re-runs the audit's own
// measurement on every `npm run check` and fails on a REGRESSION, not on the
// existing 60-strong backlog of known-unreachable commands (see the audit §4
// for why those are unreached on purpose — pending an owner decision, a
// feature flag, or an SDK).
//
// METHOD — mirrors docs/COMMAND_AUDIT_2026-08.md §1/§7 exactly, because a
// naive `invoke("name")` grep is provably wrong: it missed every call routed
// through the shim's `call()`/`editorCall()` wrappers or through a generic
// type parameter containing its own parens, and undercounted reachable
// commands by 40 (the audit's "78 vs 60" story). The correct method does not
// special-case the wrappers at all — it strips comments, then asks whether the
// command name appears ANYWHERE as a quoted string literal in the renderer
// source. That is deliberately broader than "at an invoke/call/editorCall call
// site": only a couple of files import `invoke` at all, so a string-literal hit
// anywhere in `legacy/`+`src/` (minus generated bindings, locale JSON, and test
// files) is, in practice, always a real call site. Which files those are is not
// assumed here — see `KNOWN_INVOKE_IMPORTERS` below, which fails this gate if
// the set changes.

// FAILS ONLY when:
//   - a command the baseline recorded as REACHABLE is now unreachable (a real
//     regression — something stopped calling it), or
//   - a command was registered since the baseline was generated and is
//     unreachable (an unclassified newcomer — nobody has said whether that is
//     intentional).
// A newly-registered command that IS reachable, or a previously-unreachable
// command that got wired up, both PASS — the second prints a friendly note
// that the baseline is now stale in the boring direction and can be updated.

// a file this script does not even scan.
//
// That premise used to be stated as fact in a comment above, and it was WRONG:
// it named `api-shim.ts` as the only importer while (the since-removed)
// `deeplinks.ts` had been calling `deeplink_confirm_captions` directly since
// the day both landed. The comment was copied into
// `docs/COMMAND_AUDIT_2026-08.md`, so the audit rested on it too. Nothing
// noticed, because nothing checked.
//
// So it is checked now. This is a gate, not a note: if the set changes, the
// measurement's justification has changed with it, and somebody has to re-read
// the audit rather than trust a number computed under an assumption that no
// longer holds.
